## 1. Introduction

These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern access to and use of the Midbound.ai website, software, APIs, pixels/scripts, data products, integrations, documentation, and related services (collectively, the "Services") provided by Midbound, Inc. ("Midbound," "we," "us," or "our"). By creating an account, installing our pixel or scripts, accessing, or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

If you and Midbound have executed a separate signed agreement (e.g., a Master Services Agreement, "MSA"), that agreement controls to the extent of any conflict with these Terms.

## 2. Definitions

- **Customer, you, your:** The individual or entity that accesses or uses the Services.
- **Authorized Users:** Your employees, contractors, or service providers authorized to access the Services under your account.
- **Order Form:** Any ordering document or online checkout specifying plan, features, term, and pricing.
- **Hit / Credit:** A successful identification of an otherwise anonymous website visitor, deducted from your plan quota. Unsuccessful identifications do not consume quota.
- **Submitted Data:** Data, content, or materials you or your systems submit to or through the Services.
- **Output Data:** Information, signals, or content generated or delivered by the Services for your use.
- **Midbound Platform:** Midbound's underlying technology, models, databases, algorithms, methods, and infrastructure.

## 3. Eligibility; Accounts; Security

You represent that you are at least 18 years old, have authority to bind your organization (if applicable), and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law. You are responsible for: (a) accurate, current account information; (b) safeguarding credentials and API keys; (c) ensuring only Authorized Users access the account; (d) revoking access for departing personnel within 24 hours; and (e) promptly notifying Midbound (within 24 hours) of any actual or suspected compromise. We may restrict access for competitors at our discretion.

## 4. Description of Services

The Services identify and analyze U.S.-based website visitors and in-market prospects at the person level and deliver Output Data, with optional integrations to your systems (e.g., CRM, Slack, Google Workspace). Features, limits, and quotas are as stated in your plan or Order Form and on our site.

## 5. Trials (If Offered)

- **Eligibility:** One trial per customer entity; not combinable with other promotions.
- **Scope:** Core features are enabled; certain premium capabilities may be limited. Trial accounts may receive up to 5,000 credits per company.
- **Data Access:** Output Data generated during a trial is accessible only while the trial is active. If you do not upgrade before trial end, access may be suspended.
- **No Automatic Charges:** You will not be charged unless you proactively upgrade. Upgrading starts paid service immediately and forfeits remaining trial days. You may cancel within the trial at no cost.

## 6. Subscription Plans; Fees; Payments

### Packages & Pricing

- Midbound offers packages with monthly or annual billing options, as posted on our pricing page.
- Higher-tier or enterprise subscriptions are available on an annual upfront only basis.
- Pricing may change with thirty (30) days' notice to current subscribers.

### Term & Start

- Subscriptions begin on purchase or upgrade date (or as stated on an Order Form) and continue for the stated term.

### Billing & Methods

- **Monthly Packages:** Billed in advance on the same calendar day each month.
- **Annual Packages:** Billed in advance for twelve (12) months.
- **Enterprise/High-Volume:** Billed in advance for the annual term.
- **Accepted methods:** major credit cards; wire transfer for transactions over USD $3,000.

### Auto-Renewal

Subscriptions renew automatically for successive terms matching the current billing cadence unless you disable auto-renewal in your account before the renewal date. By subscribing, you authorize recurring charges until cancellation.

### Upgrades & Downgrades

- **Upgrades:** Prorated charges for the remainder of the current cycle are billed immediately; future cycles bill at the new rate.
- **Downgrades:** Take effect at the start of the next cycle; no refunds or credits for the current cycle.

### Overages

If you exceed plan limits (e.g., credits/hits), we may charge overages at posted rates or require an upgrade.

### Refunds

All fees are non-refundable. Service credits for material disruptions caused solely by Midbound may be issued at our discretion.

### Payment Failures

If a payment attempt fails, we may notify you and retry for up to seven (7) days. Unresolved failures may result in suspension until cured.

## 7. Changes to Services, Trials, Pricing, and Terms

**Service Changes and Feature Adjustments.** We may add, modify, or remove features or functionality at any time. For changes that materially reduce core functionality of your then-current paid plan, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' advance notice (email or in-product notice), except where a faster change is required for security, legal, or performance reasons.

**Trials and Promotional Programs.** We may change, suspend, or terminate trials, credits, beta features, or promotional programs at any time.

**Pricing and Plan Structures.** We may update pricing, packaging, or overage rates prospectively with at least 30 days' notice to current subscribers; changes take effect on the next renewal or new order unless otherwise agreed in writing.

**Updates to These Terms.** We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be notified via email or in-product notice at least 30 days before they take effect, unless required sooner for legal or security reasons. Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

**Material Adverse Change—Annual Prepaid Plans.** If a notified change materially and adversely impacts a prepaid annual plan's core functionality for you, you may, within 30 days of notice, notify us in writing and (a) we will work in good faith to provide a reasonable workaround, or (b) if none is feasible, you may terminate the affected subscription effective as of the change date and receive a pro-rata refund of prepaid, unused fees for the remainder of the term.

## 8. Privacy; Data Practices; Opt-Out

Your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy (linked on our site). You are responsible for implementing required privacy and cookie notices on your properties, obtaining consents where required, honoring data-subject rights, and including an opt-out reference where applicable (e.g., to a Midbound opt-out page). Where we act as a service provider/processor, we will process personal information per your instructions and applicable law.

**CCPA "No Sale."** Midbound does not "sell" personal information as defined by the CCPA. We may share personal information with service providers to operate the Services, subject to contractual restrictions.

## 9. Data Ownership; Licenses

## 13. Confidentiality (Mutual NDA)

**Definition.** "Confidential Information" means any non-public information disclosed by a party ("Discloser") to the other ("Recipient") that is designated confidential or reasonably should be understood to be confidential, including product roadmaps, security documentation, pricing, customer lists, know-how, business plans, and non-public aspects of the Services. Customer's Submitted Data is Customer Confidential Information; Midbound's security and non-public technical information is Midbound Confidential Information.

**Obligations.** Recipient will (a) use Discloser's Confidential Information solely to perform under these Terms; (b) protect it using at least the same degree of care it uses for its own information of like importance (and no less than reasonable care); and (c) limit access to personnel, contractors, and advisors with a need to know who are bound by obligations no less protective. Recipient is responsible for their compliance.

**Exclusions.** Confidential Information excludes information that (i) is or becomes public through no fault of Recipient; (ii) was known to Recipient without restriction before disclosure; (iii) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser's information; or (iv) is rightfully received from a third party without duty of confidentiality.

**Compelled Disclosure.** Recipient may disclose Confidential Information as required by law or court order, provided it (where legally permitted) gives prompt notice and cooperates, at Discloser's expense, to seek protective treatment.

**Return/Destruction.** Upon Discloser's written request, Recipient will promptly return or destroy Confidential Information, except for archival copies retained for legal or compliance purposes, which remain subject to these obligations until deleted in the ordinary course.

**Equitable Relief.** Breach of this Section may cause irreparable harm; Discloser is entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.

Except for rights expressly granted, no licenses are implied. If you provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas, you grant Midbound a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and exploit them without restriction or attribution.

## 17. Term; Suspension; Termination

These Terms apply from the earlier of account creation, pixel installation, or first use of the Services and continue until terminated. We may suspend or terminate access for material breach, security risk, unlawful conduct, or failure to pay. You may terminate at any time via your account settings; fees are non-refundable. Upon termination, your right to access the Services and Output Data ceases, except as otherwise required by law or expressly permitted in writing.

## 18. Disclaimers

## 19. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. EXCEPT FOR (A) YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS; (B) YOUR BREACH OF SECTIONS 9–11 OR 13; OR (C) YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, EACH PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO MIDBOUND FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT FIRST GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

**Class Action Waiver.** YOU AND MIDBOUND AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING.

This Section survives termination.

## 22. Compliance; Export; Anti-Corruption

## 26. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter and supersede prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.
